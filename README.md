Apply these v2 .ips patches to a clean Pokémon Red Version ROM.  
You can find one on your own, or build [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered) to get one as well.

The patches marked "GSC Color UNOFFICIAL" were not meant to be an official release.  
They are just as far as we got before replacing the game engine. They are buggy and unsupported.
